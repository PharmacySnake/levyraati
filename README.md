Välipalautus 2.
Unfortunately I got sick, which hindered the programs development. Levyraati is not yet in Heroku.
New users can be registered, new albums can be added and viewed. Viewed albums can be sorted in different ways: date, alphapetica, artist name, album name and grade. Sort by grade doesn't workd unfortunately.
Apparently the second "Välipalautus" was yesterday. As an update I am still sick. Album cover images are displayed when viewing a specific album. 
Heroku is in working order.

Välipalautus 3.
At the moment of writing this /album doesn't work properly. It is due to some error in querying an album's information by its ID. In other ways the webpage should work as intended. Admin tools are not done.
Hopefully these get done fairly fast so that I can get to fixing known secondary bugs, polishing, adding smaller features and better visuals.
